These are closed Riemann surfaces with a flat metric on the complement of some finite number of points, around which the metric is given by cyclically gluing a finite number of half-planes.

It is shown that a faster convergence may be obtained by the new rounding<br />methods with 16-bit floating-point representation than by RN with 32-bit floating-point<br />representation.</p>\n<p class='mt-4'>Further information is available on the <a href=\"https://events.dm.unipi.it/event/201/\">event page</a> on the Indico platform.</p>\n"

This is joint work with Michel Boileau, Teruaki Kitano, and Steven Sivek.</p>\n"

We then consider their positive temperature analogues, touching upon polymer partition functions. Finally, we arrive at matrix Whittaker processes, which are integrable models of interacting Markov dynamics on matrix spaces. Our main tools are intertwining relations and the theory of Markov functions, which we will review.

Privat) on the question of the existence of optimal shapes in optimal control theory for bilinear models. Motivated by applications in spatial ecology, we investigate the following problem: consider a parabolic or elliptic equation\n\n$Lu=mu+F(u)$ where $L$ is a parabolic or elliptic operator, $m$ is the control and $F$ is a given non-linearity. The goal is to solve the optimisation problem\n\n$$Max_m \\int_\\Omega j(x;u)\\,dx$$\n\nwhere $j$ is simply a cost functional, and $m$ is an admissible control that satisfies $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ bounds. In other words, we assume $0\\le m\\le1$ almost everywhere, and $\\int_\\Omega m\\,dx=V_0$ where $V_0$ is a fixed volume constraint. A basic property for such problem is to obtain the bang-bang property for maximisers. In other words, are optimal control characteristic functions of subsets of the domain on which the equation is set? Put otherwise, can optimisers be identified with subsets of the domain? What we explain in this talk is that for bilinear control problems, the answer is analogous to the Buttazzo-DalMaso theorem: if the functional we want to optimise is monotonic, then the answer to this question is positive.

Nadin and Y. Privat) on the question of the existence of optimal shapes in optimal control theory for bilinear models. Motivated by applications in spatial ecology, we investigate the following problem: consider a parabolic or elliptic equation<br />$Lu=mu+F(u)$ where $L$ is a parabolic or elliptic operator, $m$ is the control and $F$ is a given non-linearity. The goal is to solve the optimisation problem<br />$$Max_m \\int_\\Omega j(x;u)\\,dx$$<br />where $j$ is simply a cost functional, and $m$ is an admissible control that satisfies $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ bounds. In other words, we assume $0\\le m\\le1$ almost everywhere, and $\\int_\\Omega m\\,dx=V_0$ where $V_0$ is a fixed volume constraint. A basic property for such problem is to obtain the bang-bang property for maximisers. In other words, are optimal control characteristic functions of subsets of the domain on which the equation is set? Put otherwise, can optimisers be identified with subsets of the domain? What we explain in this talk is that for bilinear control problems, the answer is analogous to the Buttazzo-DalMaso theorem: if the functional we want to optimise is monotonic, then the answer to this question is positive. Our result relies on new oscillatory techniques.</p>\n<p class='mt-4'>Further information is available on the <a href=\"https://events.dm.unipi.it/event/119/\">event page</a> on the Indico platform.</p>\n"

However, diagnosing dynamical changes such as those in atmospheric circulation patterns, remains challenging — all the more when focusing on extreme events. Here, we study 1948–2020 trends in the frequency of occurrence of atmospheric circulation patterns over the North Atlantic. We identify a positive feedback of the circulation that favors extreme events in Europe under anthropogenic forcing. Only a small number of atmospheric circulation patterns display significant trends in frequency of occurrence in recent decades, yet they have major impacts on surface climate. Increasingly frequent patterns drive summertime dryness and heatwaves across Europe, and enhanced wintertime storminess in the northern half of the continent. Roughly 95% of recent heatwave-related deaths and 33% of high impact windstorms in Europe were concurrent with the atmospheric circulation patterns whose frequency of occurrence has been increasing. Atmospheric patterns which are becoming rarer correspond instead to wet, cool summer conditions across Europe and cold conditions over the northern parts of the continent. The combined effect of these circulation changes is that of a strong, dynamically-driven year-round warming over most of the continent and increased wintertime surface winds and precipitation in Northern Europe.\n\n \nFurther information is available on the [event page](https://events.dm.unipi.it/event/112/) on the Indico platform.",

Kashiwara crystals form a monoidal category in which the tensor product is not symmetric, but the tensor products of two crystals in different orders are still connected by some functorial isomorphism called commuter. This structure is similar to braiding in the category of representations of the quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ (and, in fact, comes from it), but the commutator do not satisfy the braid group relation. In particular, on the tensor power of a given crystal, all possible commutors generate not the action of the braid group $B_n$, but the action of another group $J_n$, called the cactus group — the $S_n$-equivariant fundamental group of $\\overline{M_{0 ,n+1}}(\\mathbb{R})$, the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli spaces of real stable rational curves with $n+1$ marked points. Such monoidal categories are called coboundary. I will describe a general construction of a coboundary monoidal category as a family of compatible coverings over real Deligne-Mumford spaces, thus explaining the appearance of the real Deligne-Mumford compactification in this context.

Affine semigroups of small rank are slim, and in this setup, we obtain more precise results and the Ulrich property becomes easier to check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This talk is based on joint work with J.

By exploiting suitable notions of fractional gradient and divergence already existing in the literature, we introduce via a distributional approach the new spaces $BV^{\\alpha,p}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ of $L^p$ functions with bounded $\\alpha$-fractional variation in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and $p \\in [1, \\infty]$. In addition, we define in a similar way the distributional fractional Sobolev spaces $S^{\\alpha,p}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, which extend naturally $W^{\\alpha,p}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. The properties of these spaces have been analyzed in a series of papers in collaboration with Giorgio Stefani, Elia Bruè, Mattia Calzi and Daniel Spector. In this talk, we shall focus ourselves on the absolute continuity property of the fractional variation with respect to a suitable Hausdorff measure, and subsequently on the fractional Leibniz rules involving $BV^{\\alpha,p}$ and $S^{\\alpha,p}$ functions.

This system studies the behaviour of a molecule in a flux of nematic liquid crystals, a state of matter intermediate between the solid state and the liquid one. We consider the case with absence of flow and with energy functional unbounded from below. At the beginning, we study the stationary problem. We prove the existence of a least energy solution (when the domain is all the space) and of ground states with several open sets and boundary conditions. The last part is devoted to the evolution problem in all the space, where we establish local and global existence with small initial data. The results come from several applications of Strichartz-type estimates and by contraction arguments.",

This system studies the behaviour of a molecule in a flux of nematic liquid crystals, a state of matter intermediate between the solid state and the liquid one. We consider the case with absence of flow and with energy functional unbounded from below. At the beginning, we study the stationary problem. We prove the existence of a least energy solution (when the domain is all the space) and of ground states with several open sets and boundary conditions. The last part is devoted to the evolution problem in all the space, where we establish local and global existence with small initial data. The results come from several applications of Strichartz-type estimates and by contraction arguments. </p>\n"

Generalized matrix functions [3] are an extension of the notion of standard matrix functions to rectangular matrices, defined using the singular value decomposition instead of an eigenvalue decomposition. In this talk, we consider the computation of the action of a generalized matrix function on a vector and we present a class of algorithms based on rational Krylov methods [2]. These algorithms incorporate as a special case previous methods based on the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization [1]. By exploiting the quasiseparable structure of the projected matrices, we show that the basis vectors can be updated using a short recurrence, which can be seen as a generalization to the rational case of the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization. We also prove error bounds that relate the error of these methods to uniform rational approximation on an interval containing the singular values of the matrix. The effectiveness of the algorithms and the accuracy of the bounds is illustrated with numerical experiments. This is joint work with Angelo A. Casulli (Scuola Normale Superiore). [1] F. Arrigo, M.

Analizzeremo i nostri risultati più recenti all&#8217;interno di questo filone di ricerca, sottolineando le possibilità per nuovi sviluppi e approfondimenti. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[1] A.

We will see that the macroscopic behavior of this microscopic dynamics, under periodic boundary conditions and diffusive time scaling, is ruled by a non-linear PDE belonging to free boundary problems (or Stefan problems). One of the ingredients is to show that the system typically reaches an ergodic component in subdiffusive time. Based on joint works with O. Blondel, C. Erignoux and M. Sasada  </p>\n"

      "abstract": "#### Abstract\nSeveral variants of the graph Laplacian have been introduced to model non-local diffusion pro- cesses, which allow a random walker to “jump” to non-neighborhood nodes, most notably the path graph Laplacians and the fractional graph Laplacian, see [2, 3]. From a rigorous point of view, this new dynamics is made possible by having replaced the original graph G with a weighted complete graph G 0 on the same node-set, that depends on G and wherein the presence of new edges allows a direct passage between nodes that were not neighbors in G. A natural question arises: are the dynamics on the “old” walks along the edges of G compatible with the new dynamics? Indeed, it would be desirable to introduce long-range jumps but preserving at the same time the original dynamics if we move along the edges of G. In other words, for any time-interval where does not take place any long-range jump, a random walk on G 0 should be indistinguishable from the original random walk on G. One can easily figure this by a simple but clarifying example: let us suppose that our random walker is surfing the Net (the original graph G), and just for the sake of simplicity let us suppose that the Net is undirected. The walker then can move towards linked web-pages with a probability that can be both uniforms on the number of total links or dependent on some other parameters. Suppose now that we allow the walker to jump from one web-page to non-linked web-pages by just typing an URL address in the navigation bar so that he can virtually reach directly any possible web-pages on the Net (the induced graph G 0 ). If in any moment, for any reason, the walker is forced again to surf the Net by just following the links, then we should see him moving exactly as he used to do, namely, the probability he moves to the next linked web-page has to be the same as before. Unfortunately, in general, the induced complete graph G 0 , defined accordingly to the proposal in the literature, breaks that compatibility and the new models cease to be expressions of the original model G. In this talk, we will present some of the main results obtained in [1]. We will first introduce a rigorous definition of compatibility and embedding, which stem from a probabilistic and purely an- alytical point of view, respectively. Secondly, we will propose a regularization method to guarantee such compatibility and preserving at the same time all the nice properties granted by G 0 . References [1] D. Bianchi, M. Donatelli, F.

Darò un’idea di come le varietà algebriche reali affini siano molto flessibili, più di quelle complesse. Un classico esempio sono gli spazi proiettivi reali, i quali possono essere immersi come sottoinsiemi algebrici lisci di spazi affini reali di dimensione sufficientemente grande. In linea con queste considerazioni, il fine ultimo del seminario è dare una dimostra- zione del Teorema di Tognoli, ossia: “Ogni varietà differenziabile compatta e connessa ammette un modello algebrico affine liscio”. Questo risultato apparse negli “Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa” nel 1973 e rappresenta la soluzione di una congettura proposta da John Nash. Egli infatti provò che ogni varietà differenziabile compatta e connessa è diffeomorfa a una componente connessa liscia di una varietà algebrica reale affine; pose quindi il problema di trovare effettivamente un modello algebrico. Le tecniche coinvolte in questa dimostrazione, dovendo coniugare l’aspetto algebrico e quello differenziale, derivano da diverse aree della geometria; cercherò quindi di dare una panoramica il più precisa possibile dei risultati generali per arrivare alla dimostrazione che diede Alberto Tognoli.

Abstract: Gli operad, definiti nel 1968 da Boardman e Vogt, descrivono in maniera elegante diversi tipi di strutture algebriche. In questo seminario lavoreremo con l’operad dei piccoli n-cubi C_n che, formato da spazi di configurazioni di cubi n-dimensionali, descrive la struttura algebrica degli n-esimi gruppi di omotopia. Verrà enunciato il “Recognition principle” (P. May 1972), una delle prime importanti applicazioni di questo operad, il quale dice che uno spazio X è debolmente omotopicamente equivalente a un n-iterated loop space se e solo se X ammette un’azione dell’operad dei piccoli n-cubi.

Abstract: Gli operad, definiti nel 1968 da Boardman e Vogt, descrivono in maniera elegante diversi tipi di strutture algebriche. In questo seminario lavoreremo con l&#8217;operad dei piccoli n-cubi C_n che, formato da spazi di configurazioni di cubi n-dimensionali, descrive la struttura algebrica degli n-esimi gruppi di omotopia. Verrà enunciato il &#8220;Recognition principle&#8221; (P. May 1972), una delle prime importanti applicazioni di questo operad, il quale dice che uno spazio X è debolmente omotopicamente equivalente a un n-iterated loop space se e solo se X ammette un&#8217;azione dell&#8217;operad dei piccoli n-cubi. Infine daremo una veloce descrizione dell&#8217;omologia di C_n e delle operazioni omologiche che è possibile definire sugli iterated loop spaces usando l&#8217;azione di questo operad. </p>\n"

Made in 2004 by Michel Crouzeix, it postulates that, for any polynomial p and any matrix A, ||p(A)|| <= 2 max(|p(z)|: z in W(A)), where the norm is the 2-norm and W(A) is the field of values (numerical range) of A, that is the set of points attained by v*Av for some vector v of unit length. Crouzeix proved in 2007 that the inequality above holds if 2 is replaced by 11.08, and recently this was greatly improved by Palencia, replacing 2 by 1+sqrt(2). Furthermore, it is known that the conjecture holds in a number of special cases, including n=2. We use nonsmooth optimization to investigate the conjecture numerically by locally minimizing the “Crouzeix ratio”, defined as the quotient with numerator the right-hand side and denominator the left-hand side of the conjectured inequality. We also present local nonsmooth variational analysis of the Crouzeix ratio at conjectured global minimizers. All our results strongly support the truth of Crouzeix’s conjecture. This is joint work with Anne Greenbaum and Adrian Lewis.",

We use nonsmooth optimization to investigate the conjecture numerically by locally minimizing the “Crouzeix ratio”, defined as the quotient with numerator the right-hand side and denominator the left-hand side of the conjectured inequality. We also present local nonsmooth variational analysis of the Crouzeix ratio at conjectured global minimizers. All our results strongly support the truth of Crouzeix’s conjecture. This is joint work with Anne Greenbaum and Adrian Lewis. </p>\n"

Finally, if we have enough time, we will discuss the precise computation of the ideal simplicial volume of an infinite family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary, for which the exact value of the classical simplicial volume is not known. This is a joint work with Roberto Frigerio </p>\n"

It turns out that the knots up to concordance form an Abelian group with respect to the connected sum. The study of the concordance group of knots is a central topic in knot theory, and low dimensional topology in general.

In this seminar, after a general introduction to the concordance group, and to the above mentioned problems, we will talk about a large family of concordance invariants defined from link homologies.

Using tools from nonnegative matrix theory, we prove that both methods are locally convergent to the fixed point, with linear and quadratic rate of convergence, respectively.We compare these methods with an existing algorithm, concluding that the Newton-Raphson iteration is a preferable choice for G-networks with a moderate number of queues. We conclude by suggesting a possible application for future research. </p>\n"

      "abstract": "#### Venue\nSala Riunioni (Dip. Matematica).\n\n#### Abstract\nEigenvalues for tensors were introduced in 2005. Since then, a rich theory on eigenvalues of tensors and special tensors has been developed. There are two main definitions of eigenvalues of tensors.   One definition is based upon  homogeneous polynomial systems.   This definition extends the definition of eigenvalues of matrices.  A complex number is an eigenvalue of a “square” tensor if and only if it is a root of the characteristic polynomial of that tensor.  The sum of all the eigenvalues of that tensor is equal to the sum of the diagonal entries of that tensor, while the product of all the eigenvalues of that tensor is equal to the determinant of that tensor.  An eigenvalue of a real tensor with a real eigenvector is called an H-eigenvalue.  An even order real  symmetric tensor is positive semi-definite if and only if all of its H-eigenvalues are nonnegative. Various tensor eigenvalue inclusion theorems have been developed. Another tensor eigenvalue definition has the merit that the eigenvalues under this definition are invariant under orthonormal transformations. This makes eigenvalues under this definition found their applications in engineering, physics and mechanics.  Based upon the tensor eigenvalue theory, theories on special tensors have also been developed.   In particular, the Perron-Frobenius theory for irreducible nonnegative tensors and weakly irreducible nonnegative tensors has been developed, and found applications in spectral hypergraph theory and higher order Markov chains.  Other special tensors include positive semi-definite tensors,  sum-of-squares tensors,  completely positive tensors and copositive tensors, etc. Eigenvalues of tensors also found their applications in magnetic resonance imaging, elastic mechanics, liquid crystal study, quantum entanglement and classicality problems, etc.  A book “Tensor Analysis: Spectral Theory and Special Tensors” is published by SIAM in April this year.",

These symplectomorphisms are known as Dehn twists, and they exist for those symplectic 4-manifolds which admit an embedded Lagrangian 2-sphere.Later Seidel proved that Dehn twists are of infinite order in the symplectic mapping class groups of certain symplectic K3 surfaces.In spite of this deep result of Seidel, and other results that followed it, we still have no general way to construct non-isotopic symplectomorphisms for 4-manifolds.For instance, there are 4-manifolds which do not contain Lagrangian spheres, yet it is believed that they have a non-trivial symplectic mapping class group. In this talk we will introduce and study a new type of symplectomorphisms for symplectic 4-manifolds and discuss some examples of symplectic 4-manifolds for which these new twists are infinite order elements in the symplectic mapping class groups.

These symplectomorphisms are known as Dehn twists, and they exist for those symplectic 4-manifolds which admit an embedded Lagrangian 2-sphere.Later Seidel proved that Dehn twists are of infinite order in the symplectic mapping class groups of certain symplectic K3 surfaces.In spite of this deep result of Seidel, and other results that followed it, we still have no general way to construct non-isotopic symplectomorphisms for 4-manifolds.For instance, there are 4-manifolds which do not contain Lagrangian spheres, yet it is believed that they have a non-trivial symplectic mapping class group. In this talk we will introduce and study a new type of symplectomorphisms for symplectic 4-manifolds and discuss some examples of symplectic 4-manifolds for which these new twists are infinite order elements in the symplectic mapping class groups. This is a joint work with Vsevolod Shevchishin. </p>\n"

Matematica).\n\n#### Abstract\nWe present our recent extension of Allard’s celebrated rectifiability theorem to the setting of varifolds with locally bounded first variation with respect to an anisotropic integrand. In partic- ular, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the integrand to obtain the rectifiability of every d-dimensional varifold with locally bounded first variation and positive d-dimensional density. In codimension one, this condition is shown to be equivalent to the strict convexity of the integrand with respect to the tangent plane. We can apply this result to the minimization of anisotropic energies among families of d- rectifiable closed subsets of Rn, closed under Lipschitz deformations (in any dimension and codimension). Easy corollaries of this compactness result are the solutions to three formulations of the Plateau problem: one introduced by Reifenberg, one proposed by Harrison and Pugh and another one studied by Guy David. Moreover, we apply the rectifiability theorem to the energy minimization in classes of vari- folds and to a compactness result of integral varifolds in the anisotropic setting. Finally, we show some connections of the Plateau problem with branched transport, min- imizing concave costs among 1-dimensional currents. In particular, we prove a stability result for the optimal transports. References  \\t[1] G. De Philippis, A. De Rosa, and F. Ghiraldin.

Nella modellazione matematica della angiogenesi tumorale, il forte accoppiamento tra i processi stocastici di diramazione-elongazione-morte di vasi, e i campi biochimici dovuti alla massa tumorale, è causa di forte complessità dal punto di vista sia analitico che computazionale.

In tal modo i parametri cinetici dei processi (stocastici) di formazione della rete divengono deterministici. Purtroppo a causa della anastomosi, non è possibile garantire le condizioni di applicabilità tipiche della propagazione del caos, che quindi viene messa in discussione. Una possibile derivazione di equazioni di evoluzione deterministiche per i campi fa ricorso alla media su molte repliche dei processi coinvolti, secondo leggi classiche dei grandi numeri.

In practice, all roots of polynomials of degree more than a million are found routinely and in (4log 2) d^2 iterations — in practice, this means less than a day for degree a million on standard laptops.

We give a very efficient theoretical upper bound on its speed of convergence: all roots of a degree d polynomial can be found with accuracy eps in O(d^2 log^4 d + d log\\log eps) Newton iterations in the expected case — very close to the theoretical upper bound of O(d^2) for this method. In practice, all roots of polynomials of degree more than a million are found routinely and in (4log 2) d^2 iterations — in practice, this means less than a day for degree a million on standard laptops. A modified method, for which we do not yet have a complete theory, brings this down to 3 d log^2 d iterations, which in practice for certain polynomials finds all roots of degree a million in a matter of minutes. </p>\n"

Matematica).\n\n#### Abstract\nThis talk is concerned with the macroscopic behavior of global energy minimizers in the three-dimensional sharp interface Ohta-Kawasaki model of diblock copolymer melts. We are interested in the large volume behavior of minimizers in the low volume fraction regime, in which one expects the formation of a periodic lattice of small droplets of the minority phase in a sea of the majority phase. Under periodic boundary conditions, we show that the considered energy converges to a function of the limit “homogenized” measure associated with the minority phase, consisting of a local linear term and a non-local quadratic term mediated by the Coulomb kernel.

      "oldAbstract": "<h4>Venue</h4>\n<p>Sala Seminari (Dip. Matematica).</p>\n<h4 class='mt-4'>Abstract</h4>\n<p>This talk is concerned with the macroscopic behavior of global energy minimizers in the three-dimensional sharp interface Ohta-Kawasaki model of diblock copolymer melts. We are interested in the large volume behavior of minimizers in the low volume fraction regime, in which one expects the formation of a periodic lattice of small droplets of the minority phase in a sea of the majority phase. Under periodic boundary conditions, we show that the considered energy converges to a function of the limit &#8220;homogenized&#8221; measure associated with the minority phase, consisting of a local linear term and a non-local quadratic term mediated by the Coulomb kernel. As a consequence, asymptotically the mass of the minority phase in a minimizer spreads evenly across the domain. We also prove that the energy density distributes uniformly across the domain as well, with the energy density approaching that of the minimizers of the volume constrained problem in the whole space. This suggest that in the microscopic limit the minimizers should appear as a uniformly distributed array of droplets which minimize the energy density for the volume constrained whole space problem. </p>\n"

After summarizing the main known facts concerning the conjecture, we will present two new results. First, we generalize to number fields a theorem which was proved over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Stix: we prove that if $k$ is a number field and the Weil restriction of $X$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$ admits a rational map to a non-trivial Brauer-Severi variety, then $X$ satisfies the conjecture.

      "oldAbstract": "<h4>Venue</h4>\n<p>Dipartimento di Matematica, Aula Magna.</p>\n<h4 class='mt-4'>Abstract</h4>\n<p>Grothendieck&#8217;s Section Conjecture states that, if $X$ is an hyperbolic curve over a field $k$ finitely generated over $\\mathbb{Q}$, every section of the map $\\pi_1(X) \\to \\mathsf{Gal}(k)$ is associated with a rational point of the completion of $X$. After summarizing the main known facts concerning the conjecture, we will present two new results. First, we generalize to number fields a theorem which was proved over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Stix: we prove that if $k$ is a number field and the Weil restriction of $X$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$ admits a rational map to a non-trivial Brauer-Severi variety, then $X$ satisfies the conjecture. Secondly, if $k$ is finitely generated over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we prove that the conjecture holds for sections which satisfy a strong birationality assumption. In particular, this implies that the section conjecture is equivalent to Esnault and Hai&#8217;s cuspidalization conjecture, which states that every Galois section of every hyperbolic curve $X$ lifts to every open subset of $X$.</p>\n<p class='mt-4'>Further information is available on the <a href=\"https://events.dm.unipi.it/event/73/\">event page</a> on the Indico platform.</p>\n"

      "oldAbstract": "\n<p>Negli ultimi anni si sta cercando di passare dalla realtà virtuale alla realtà aumentata, ma ogni progresso in questa direzione richiede avanzamenti nella comprensione del mondo fisico attraverso la computer<br>vision, alla base della quale oltre alle reti neurali giocano una parte anche svariati problemi di matematica. Introdurrò brevemente i problemi matematici che ho incontrato nella computer vision, a partire dal bundle adjustment, il problema di ottimizzazione per il quale sono stato assunto a Scape Technologies, e problemi di teoria dei grafi e algebra (basi di Groebner) legati al lavoro svolto nel mio gruppo.
